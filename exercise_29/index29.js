/*
    Favorite Fruit: 
    Make a array of your favorite fruits, 
    and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
    • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
    • Write five if statements. 
    Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. 
    If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement,
    such as You really like bananas!
