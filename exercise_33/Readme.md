# Exercises No. 33

## Problem Statement:-

- Ordinal Numbers:

  such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
  - Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a array.
  - Loop through the array.
  - Use an if-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number.

    7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.
