              Think of at least five places in the world you'd like to visit.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in
                  alphabetical order.
                </li>
                <li>Print your array in its original order.</li>
                <li>
                  Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the
                  actual list.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Show that your array is still in its original order by
                  printing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without
                  changing the order of the original list.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Show that your array is still in its original order by
                  printing it again.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that
                  its order has changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show
                  it's back to its original order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sort your array so it's stored in alphabetical order. Print
                  the array to show that its order has been changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sort to change your array so it's stored in reverse
                  alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has
                  changed.
