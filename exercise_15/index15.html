            <li>
              You just heard that one of your guests can't make the dinner, so
              you need to send out a new set of invitations. You'll have to
              think of someone else to invite.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print
                  statement at the end of your program stating the name of the
                  guest who can't make it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can't
                  make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person
                  who is still in your list.
